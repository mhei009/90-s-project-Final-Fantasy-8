                    The combat in Final Fantasy VIII is menu driven and uses the Active Time Battle (ATB) system to
                    determine when characters and enemies can perform actions. It features a bar that slowly fills up,
                    and when it does, it allows the player to choose a command.</p>

                    Active mode is a battle mode where the

                    GFs can be summoned in battle with the “GF” Command. This will result in a special command being
                    performed that is unique to each GF. These commands can vary from multi-target elemental attacks to
                    commands that buff the party.

                <p class="section__paragraph">Summoning a GF will initially swap your character’s health bar with the
                    GF’s HP and the Charge Time
                    gauge (as shown by the blue bar next to the GF’s name). The charge time goes down and denotes how
                    much time is left before the GF’s unique command is used. The speed at which the Charge Time goess
                    down is based on a GF’s Compatibility with the character they are junctioned to.</p>

                    character will instead damage
                    the GF and affect their HP. If a GF’s HP falls to zero, then the summon will be canceled and the GF
                    can’t be summoned again until they are revived. However, you can still junction them and they can
                    receive AP and EXP as normal.
