Fan website created by a noob. for the brief of 90Â´s inspired website 

Final Fantasy VIII Project Ragnarok
Is a fanmade responsive website project for HTML & CSS Fundamentals course. Although a little Javascript is added for the modal box and the scroll up button.
My main goal is to learn the fundamentals of html and CSS and be comfortable in coding them in the future.
