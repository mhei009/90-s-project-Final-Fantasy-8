                                        <br>Despite his young age, Squall is highly skilled and a natural leader, but he
                                        often keeps his
                                        emotions in check and maintains a stoic and distant demeanor.<br>

                                        Ultimecia is a powerful and malevolent sorceress who serves as the central

                                        immense magical powers. Her goal is to compress time and merge all eras into

                                        become the ruler of the present time.</p>
